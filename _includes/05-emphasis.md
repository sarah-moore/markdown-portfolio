I am a scholar of political conflict and violence, land disposession, and state capacity building in rural Latin America. I have conducted *months* of fieldwork in Colombia to understand more about political life and informal institutions in the wake of civil war. I also research and innovate mixed methods research, all of which I consider and develop in the context of **hard-to-research or difficult-to-measure phenomena**, such as civil war.
